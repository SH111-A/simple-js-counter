# Simple JS Counter

A basic, user-friendly counter application built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app features increment and decrement buttons that update the displayed count in real-time, with styling that includes a sleek glow effect and a custom font.

## Features

- Prevents count from decreasing below 1
- Stylish UI with custom font and subtle glow effect
- Clean and minimal code with separation of HTML, CSS, and JS
- Easy to extend and customize for any project

## Project Structure

- `index.html` — Main structure of the counter interface
- `style.css` — Styling for layout, colors, fonts, and button appearance
- `index.js` — JavaScript logic for increasing and decreasing the count

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Click the "+" button to increase the count.
4. Click the "−" button to decrease the count (won't go below 1).


## Styling Notes
